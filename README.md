# Molecular Generation using cLatentGAN and cVAE for functional group controlling and multi objective Baysian optimization of pharamacokintic properties 
In the realm of molecular generation, having the ability for a controlled generation (in terms of functional groups of the generated molecule) and to optimize several properties is crucial for research. 
This work composed of the main codes of the training and analysis througout the project. 
Data for training was taken from Chembl publicly available database
